<h2>Observations</h2>

None of the extras were done. The use of Next.JS was considered, but the implementation of the project had already started, and this framework needs to be defined at the beginning of the development. Furthermore, the idea of implementing the 'Storybook' and 'Unit tests' technologies was also considered, but, due to the remaining time for the project delivery, it was decided not to use them.
